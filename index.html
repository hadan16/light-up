				<h1>Awareness</h1>
				<p>Live with **AWARENESS** - On Step 1, the fog is all up in our shit, thick and close and clogging our senses, leaving us going through life unconscious and intoxicated by primitive emotions and thoughts.</p>

				<img src="images/animals-in-fog.jpg"  height="360" width="385">

				<p>Fear, neediness, judgement, pettiness, jealousy, greed, and instant gratification</p>

				<p>Removing this fog through regular meditation, mindfulness, and exercise helps with feeling a more consistent and deeper calm, clarity, and contentment. The small-minded animal emotions will be less in our face, the sky will stay blue and cloudless more often, and the more advanced emotions of the higher being -- love, compassion, humility, and empathy will *begin to light up.</p>
			<div class="hide-show2"
				<p class="hidden">(Hidden) I love Whoa moments. They make me feel some intense combination of awe, elation, sadness, and wonder. More than anything, they make me feel ridiculously, profoundly humble—and that level of humility does weird things to a person. In those moments, all those words religious people use—awe, worship, miracle, eternal connection—make perfect sense. I want to get on my knees and surrender. This is when I feel spiritual. And in those fleeting moments, there is no fog—my Higher Being is in full flow and can see everything in perfect clarity.</p>

					<div class="hide-show">
						<h3 class="hide">Creating Habits to Achieve Goals (hidden)</h3>
							<p class="hide">Set big goals and break them down to smaller goals that if completed consistently, will lead to the inevitable accomplishment of the big goal. Then make these small goals part of a habit that can be completed as part of your routine. Its likely that you'll become so intent on these daily victories that you may not even realize one of the big goals has occurred until it’s already passed you by. — Research shows that habits only need about 30 days of consistent effort to install themselves into our brains. At that point they begin to become automatic.</p>
							<p class="hide">At first, without judging yourself, make simply showing up the only requirement for success. Tweak your existing routines to put yourself in a position that would make it simpler to begin. The trick is to focus on initiating these cues instead of just the task itself. I.e. going straight to your room and changing to workout clothes after getting home from work.</p>
